Welcome to the REST API for Baker Street! You can use our API to create view and edit products on Baker Street Online Store.
Baker Street is inspired from Sherlock Homes :) 


Baker Street API is built using REST principles and without any framework in mind. This API follows HTTP rules, enabling a wide range of HTTP clients can be used to interact with the API.

URL is https://bakerstreetwala.herokuapp.com *I could not get bakerstreet on heroku*


## Getting Started
All Baker Street API calls requires a minimum of one mandatory header.

```
Authorization token - Authentication request header.
```
   
## Authentication
All Baker Street API calls need to be authenticated using an authtoken.

You can obtain an authtoken by the following way:

Submit an HTTP POST request to the below URL.

https://bakerstreetwala.herokuapp.com/authtoken/create.

Below are the mandatory case sensitive fields to be passed in POST request. 

Example: 

parameter     | value
------------- | -------------
username      | admin
password      | admin


###Example
```
curl -i "https://bakerstreetwala.herokuapp.com/authtoken/create"\
	  -d "username=admin&password=admin"
```

###Response  

```
{
    "content": {
        "token": "58712b8969a5a"
    }
}
```


###POINTS TO NOTE

1) every time you create a new token, previous token will be invalidated. 

2) all requests should have token as authentication field.

### Sample Test Cases Execution

####Automated Testing

###Test Cases for Authentication: 
***

**Test 1- username**: usernotpresent and password: junk 

*Test case passed UserNotFoundException is thrown*

**Test 2- username**: admin and password: junk 

*Test case passed PasswordNotMatchException is thrown*

**Test 3- username**: admin and password: admin 

*Test case passed*

**All tests for authtication passed New Token: 587280c834e05**

Now all the tests will use this token : 587280c834e05 for authentication

**Test 4** : Get products without authtication GET /products 

*Test case passed 401 Unauthorized recieved* 

**Test 5** : Get products without authtication GET /products and wrong token

*Test case passed 401 Unauthorized recieved*

**Test 6** : Get products without authtication GET /products and correct token: 587280c834e05 

*Test case passed*


###Test Cases for Products: 
***

**Test 7** : POST /products with token and name and description 

*Test case passed Product created with id: 2*

**Test 8** : GET /products/2 with token and productid 

*Test case passed Product*

**Test 9** : PUT /products/2 with token and name and description 

*Test case passed*


**Test 10** : DELETE /products/{productid} with token 

*Test case passed*


"All Tests Passed"

####Assumptions:

1) currently token is not expiring, we should have a expiry time for the token. 

2) URL does not have multiple slash together like ///
