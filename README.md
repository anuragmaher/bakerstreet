# REST API for Baker Street Store

Welcome to the REST API for Baker Street! You can use our API to create view and edit products on Baker Street Online Store.
Baker Street is inspired from Sherlock Homes :) 


Baker Street API is built using REST principles and without any framework in mind. This API follows HTTP rules, enabling a wide range of HTTP clients can be used to interact with the API.

URL is https://bakerstreetwala.heroku.com *I could not get bakerstreet on heroku*


## Getting Started
All Baker Street API calls requires a minimum of one mandatory header.

```
Authorization token - Authentication request header.
```
   
## Authentication
All Baker Street API calls need to be authenticated using an authtoken.

You can obtain an authtoken by the following way:

Submit an HTTP POST request to the below URL.

https://bakerstreetwala.herokuapp.com/authtoken/create.

Below are the mandatory case sensitive fields to be passed in POST request. 

Example: 

parameter     | value
------------- | -------------
username      | admin
password      | admin


Return value will be like 

```
{
    "error": null,
    "content": {
        "expires": 1408109484,       // yet to be implemented
        "token": "58712b8969a5a"
    }
}
```
**TODO: expires is not implemented yet**

###Example
```
curl -i "https://bakerstreetwala.herokuapp.com/authtoken/create"\
	  -d "username=admin&password=admin"
```


###POINTS TO NOTE

1) every time you create a new token, previous token will be invalidated. 

2) token response will have a expiry time for the token, after which you will have to re generate the token.

3) all requests should have token as authentication field.
